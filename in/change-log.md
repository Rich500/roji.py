## Change log

### 30/9/2020

I dropped sakura.css for [tufte-css](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css). Reason, purely simple: I like it for my personal website. In the future it would be neat to select, or make it easier to choose, a classless css. 

Paths/Addresses are all in lower now to avoid problems on my host. 

Topics can be linked with brackets &#123;Â  &#125;

I could do with a function to deal with different date types. At the moment the script needs d/m/yyyy. 


### 23/9/2020

Constantly playing with ideas, toying with code, the project got a little out of hand. I stumbled on this amazing clean code and became inspired.

#### Changes:

- Using the fast cmarkgfm package for markdown.
- Rewrote everything.
- Started using pathlib like I should have done in the first place.
- Added a tag system in the form of topics. This still needs to be streamlinned. 
- Neatened the Jinja2 rendering.
- Decided against a directory. It didn't fit the digital garden ethos. 

#### Thinking about:

- I have spent too much time on this, but have learnt a lot.
- Drop in classless css framworks ( https://github.com/dohliam/dropin-minimal-css ) are great.
- I need to build my notes up rather than constantly playing with this.

Changed backend from YAML and pystache to frontend and jinja2 modules. This made processing faster and gives better options. There is now a index and page template, and I'm trying to build a simple menu or categories but I'm stumped on how to organize the posts data by a topic adopted from yaml.

There are also changes to layout/template, keeping it even more simple by removing extra css and using pure html tables for header.
