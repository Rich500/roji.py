\- Using the fast cmarkgfm package for markdown.

\- Rewrote everything.

\- Started using pathlib like I should have done in the first place.

\- Added a tag system in the form of topics. This still needs to be streamlined. 

\- Neatened the Jinja2 rendering.

\- Decided against a directory. It didn't fit the digital garden ethos. 

\- I have spent too much time on this, but have learnt a lot.

\- Drop in classless css framworks ( https://github.com/dohliam/dropin-minimal-css ) are great.

\- I need to build my notes up rather than constantly playing with this.
