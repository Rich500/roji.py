## Digital garden?

Rather than a blog -a restrictive stream of self promotion and diarrhoea, a digital garden is a place to grow ideas. For a better explanation see [maggieappleton.com/garden-history](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)


## Change log

### 13/9/2020
Changed backend from YAML and pystache to frontend and jinja2 modules. This made processing faster and gives better options. There is now a index and page template, and I'm trying to build a simple menu or categories but I'm stumped on how to organize the posts data by a topic adopted from yaml.

There are also changes to layout/template, keeping it even more simple by removing extra css and using pure html tables for header.
