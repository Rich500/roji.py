Changed backend from YAML and pystache to frontend and jinja2 modules. This made processing faster and gives better options. There is now a index and page template, and I'm trying to build a simple menu or categories but I'm stumped on how to organize the posts data by a topic adopted from yaml.



There are also changes to layout/template, keeping it even more simple by removing extra css and using pure html tables for header.
