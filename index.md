## Roji.py

My hobbyist attempt at a static digital garden generator for my notes.

It *aims* to be small and simple.

A folder of markdown files are processed into pages and topics.

Pages are linked through wikilink style &#91;&#91;brackets &#93;&#93;.

Topics are listed with the YAML of the markdown files, each topic has its own page, and can be linked to with &#123;topic&#125;.


## Why?

Most static site generators concentrate on the blog format. Frustrated, I made my own, inspired by this [article](https://medium.com/swlh/a-static-site-generator-in-python-part-2-d7071da25904), so that I could transform academic and personal notes into a simple website. 

## some example pages

- [[a page]] - internal links are made by brackets
- [[gardens]]
