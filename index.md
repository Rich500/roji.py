## Roji.py

My hobbyist attempt at a static digital garden generator for my notes.

It *aims* to be small and simple.



## Why?

Most static site generators concentrate on the blog format. Frustrated, I made my own, inspired by this [article](https://medium.com/swlh/a-static-site-generator-in-python-part-2-d7071da25904), so that I could transform academic and personal notes into a simple website. 

## some example pages

- [[a page]] - internal links are made by brackets

- [[gardens]]

- [[image example]]
