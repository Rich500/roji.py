## About Roji.py

My hobbyist attempt at a static digital garden generator for my notes. It *aims* to be small and simple. 

A folder of markdown files are processed into HTML pages and topics.

Pages are linked through wikilink style &#91;&#91;brackets &#93;&#93;. For example [[gardens]].

Topics are listed with the YAML of the markdown files, each topic has its own page, and can be linked to with &#123;topic&#125;. For example {garden}.


## Why?

Most static site generators concentrate on the blog format. Frustrated, I made my own, inspired by this [article](https://medium.com/swlh/a-static-site-generator-in-python-part-2-d7071da25904), so that I could transform academic and personal notes into a simple website.
