## About
A roji.py is a WIP static site generator project aiming for simplicity and the digital garden format. 

## Why?
Most static site generators concentrate on the blog format. Frustrated, I made my own so that I could transform academic and personal notes into a simple website.

## Installing 
Clone the repo and install requirements.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
Add markdown files to the *in* folder and any images into *imgs*, and then run...
```
python3 rojy.py
```
This will create a html site in */docs*.
