## Roji.py

My hobbyist attempt at a static digital garden generator for my notes.

It *aims* to be small and simple.

It has [[wiki style links]], backlinks and a tag system for hyperlinking. 

## Why?

Most static site generators concentrate on the blog format. Frustrated, I made my own, inspired by this [article](https://medium.com/swlh/a-static-site-generator-in-python-part-2-d7071da25904), so that I could transform academic and personal notes into a simple website. 

## Installing 
Clone the repo and install requirements.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
Add markdown files to the *in* folder and any images into *imgs*, and then run...
```
python3 roji.py
```
This will create a html site in */docs*. Changes can be made in the template.html and roji.py itself.
