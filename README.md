## About
Roji.py is a WIP static site generator project aiming for simplicity and the digital garden format 🌱. 

## Why?
Most static site generators concentrate on the blog format. Frustrated, I made my own, inspired by this [article](https://medium.com/swlh/a-static-site-generator-in-python-part-2-d7071da25904), so that I could transform academic and personal notes into a simple website. 

## Installing 
Clone the repo and install requirements.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
Add markdown files to the *in* folder and any images into *imgs*, and then run...
```
python3 roji.py
```
This will create a html site in */docs*. Changes can be made in the template.html and roji.py itself. 

## Things to do 🍃
- generate a sitemap or directory 
- add a search?
- add anchor points for headers
- allow for images on root index
- better js for switching css
- rewrite paths 
- be more creative
- have more fun 🙌
